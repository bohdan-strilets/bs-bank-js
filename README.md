Through this project, insights into the inner workings of popular frameworks like React, Redux, and Router were gained.

## Features

- Single Page Application (SPA)
- Written in pure JavaScript
- Uses SCSS for styling
- Webpack for module bundling
- Babel for JavaScript transpilation
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting
